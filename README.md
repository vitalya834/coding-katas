# JavaScript Coding Katas

## Getting started

- [ ] `Download` this repository (Avoid to clone it, use download instead)
- [ ] Open the project folder in your VS Code
- [ ] All katas are in a separate folder
- [ ] Each kata has an index.html, a script file (where you should implement your solution) and a test file (That contains tests, like codewars).
- [ ] The test file will be automatically executed when loading the index.html
  - Use your installed VS Code Extension Live Server Extension to start one of the index.html files
- [ ] Try to implement your solution in the `script file` of the folder
- [ ] Do not forget to add git versioning!
